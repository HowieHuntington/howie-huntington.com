Professional Life:
1. What is your current job title and responsibilities?
		a. I am a Software Engineer, mainly focusing in Frontend UI development.  My most recent position was with T-Mobile as a full-stack software engineer, where I turned complex business requirements into easy -to-use and visual and responsive UI's, provided application support using observability tools such as Splunk, and worked on API enhancements.  
2.  Can you provide a brief overview of your career progression?
		a. I moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014 to get my Computer Science degree at Georgia State University. After I finished, I started working at General Motors as a software engineer, developing user interfaces for dealer facing web applications.  
		Then I was looking for more varied work, I joined T-Mobile as a full-stack engineer. There, I built and supported after high-traffic web applications used across the country. I got to combine UI and API development and learned how to monitor performance using observability tools such as splunk. Lately, I've become really interested in AI, particularly OpenAI, Langchain, and Custom Knowledge Bases. I've been learning how to incorporate these into my web applications. Now, I'm searching for jobs that let me use my UI skills and this new interest in AI to move forward in my career.
		
		
3. What are some of your major accomplishments in your current and previous roles?
		a. Recently, I'm proud of building the AI chatbot assistant you're using now. I built it in my free time outside of work and it required me to learn a lot about LLMs, Langchain, and using OpenAI's NLP platform with a custom knowledge, vectorized data store. The interface is built with Nextjs for fast load times and good SEO, and it uses reactjs components and modern styling with css in Tailwind. The server side code is also written in Nextjs' serverless cloud functions, and it's hosted by Vercel.
		
		b.  At T-Mobile, as a Full Stack Software Engineer, I led the development of a One-Time Pin UI for Multi Factor Authentication. I had to organize the development process, make sure changes from different developers fit together, and keep our processes on track. I enjoyed improving communication and getting all our requirements straight, which helped reduce mistakes.
		
		I was hands-on and did detailed code reviews, which I think is key to keeping code quality high and sticking to the best design patterns. I also made sure we had unit tests that covered 100% of the code, giving us confidence in our work and reducing mistakes even more.
		
		In addition, I was responsible for managing static content, which was important to make sure all the content was included in our code changes.
		
		When the feature was launched, I supported the deployment because I knew the project inside and out and had become the subject matter expert. This helped us have a smooth, bug-free release, which was a big success for me and my team.
		
		c. In my role at General Motors, a major accomplishment I achieved was the planning and integration of our retail application into the GM online purchasing platform called Shop, Click, Drive.  This involved handling several responsive data forms which rendered differently based on purchasing details such as financing options and trade-in values.  In order to achieve this led the initiative to refine user stories in order to identify requirements gaps, organize a development process between myself and another dev, perform code reviews, and write unit tests. 
4. What tools and technologies are you proficient in?
		a. I have a demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of technologies including but not limited to:
			i. JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Tailwind), UI Libraries and Frameworks (React.js, Next.js, Angular 14+), Java, Spring Boot, Node, OpenAI, Langchain, Vector Data Stores (Pinecone), Serverless Architecture
5. Can you describe some of the most challenging projects you have worked on and how you handled them?
		a. When I was at General Motors, COVID-19 forced us to quickly connect our dealership-specific web app with GM's online buying platform, Shop, Click, Drive. This important project required me to quickly adapt and get good at UI development, specifically in Angular - which I had just started learning. Despite the difficulty and tight deadline, I threw myself into learning: I read the documentation, studied the code, debugged in the browser, and took an online course to improve my Angular skills. All this hard work paid off: I worked closely with our Senior UI Lead to plan, develop, and test key UI modules for the project. I was praised for learning fast and providing reliable solutions, showing that I can grow and adapt when faced with challenges.

		
6. Can you provide a brief summary of your educational background?
		a. From 2016 to 2019, I studied Computer Science at Georgia State University. I got high grades, making it onto the Dean's List and the President's List, and graduated with high honors. I did all of this while working full-time to pay for school. During my summer breaks, instead of taking more classes, I looked for practical experience through internships. I spent one summer working as a Ruby on Rails Developer Intern at a startup called Hawaii Camera, and another summer working as a QA Engineer Intern at Fiserv.
		
7. What are your areas of expertise in your field?
		a. As a full-stack engineer, I'm good at adapting to different programming languages and can help support web apps across many industries. I specialize in frontend development and take pride in creating precise, responsive UI modules. With the growing interest in AI in tech, I'm committed to learning new tools and methods to create better user experiences.
		
8. Can you share your experience about working in a team environment?
		a. I've always found it rewarding to work in a team. For example, at General Motors, I worked with my team to connect our app with an online purchasing platform - a big task that we managed to complete on time. At T-Mobile, I was trusted with leadership tasks like planning development strategies, reviewing code, and providing deployment support for major feature releases. I've learned how important it is to communicate clearly and make sure everyone understands what's going on. My teammates have praised me for taking the initiative, taking responsibility, including everyone, and helping others. They also like that I'm always looking for ways to improve what we do and the user experience. I believe these experiences show that I work well in a team.

9. How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure at work?
		a. At T-Mobile, I once had to take on a big project that had to be finished by the end of the year. A lot of people were out on vacation, so I knew I couldn't afford any mistakes. My strategy was to talk to all the developers to make sure we were on the same page, list out all the tasks we needed to do, double-check everything, and test the application thoroughly. In the end, we finished the project on time, didn't have any major issues or roadblocks
		

10. How do you keep your skills and knowledge up-to-date?
		a. I'm always naturally curious about the latest tech trends. I know that what I know today might not be as relevant tomorrow, so I'm always trying to learn new things. This way, I keep up with all the new developments and make sure I don't fall behind.
		
11. What are your long-term professional goals?
		a.  I'm driven by my interests and I like to help others who are interested in the same things. In the long run, I want to create new tech solutions that make life easier for everyday people, and share what I know with others who are just starting out.  To sum it up, I just want to work on interesting tech and have the opportunity to teach others.  
		
12. Can you describe your leadership style?
